# DefiKingdoms contract interaction helper

## Live (hopefully) at: https://dfk-interact.surge.sh/

## Why? To allow making transaction using non DFK UI if needed
DFK's contract's aren't verified, so interacting directly on the block explorer is not available.

If DFK's UI (e.g. tavern) isn't working correctly, other community resources can be used for information, and this can be used for transacting (e.g. bidding).

## Usage gotchas
1. Don't forget to make the numbers into 18 decimals format by pressing the ðŸ’¥ button
